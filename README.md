# MyFirstDLproject-MNIST
This is my first training project in which no complex deep learning method is used and it is implemented with basic techniques and 3 layers of neural network.
The dataset used is the famous MNIST dataset
I used 60,000 data for neural network training and 10,000 data for testing.
Finally, I reached 97% accuracy
